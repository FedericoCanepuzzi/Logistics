## Introduction
The project require to solve a logistic problem in which we have to place parking lots on both sides of a road in such a way to balance the amount of space occupied by each side of the road as much as possible. 

Then it is required to code the optimization problem in AMPL programming language and compute the result using CPLEX solver.

## ILP formulation
